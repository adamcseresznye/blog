<p>Once I shared my first article about <a href="https://adamcseresznye.github.io/blog/posts/polars/Polars_revised.html">“Getting Started with Polars”</a> I started thinking about something exciting: comparing the speed of Polars and Pandas. This curiosity was sparked by all the buzz around the brand-new <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html">Pandas 2.0 release</a>, promising lightning-fast performance. Pandas 2.0 was announced to come packed with cool features, including the addition of Apache Arrow (pyarrow) as its backing memory format. The big perk of Apache Arrow is that it makes operations speedier and more memory-friendly. Naturally, this got me wondering: how does Pandas 2.0 measure up against Polars? Let’s dive in and find out!</p>

<p>Keep in mind: occasionally, I refer to some performance difference figures. Even though I repeated these experiments 100 times each, because computations can have a bit of randomness, there might be slight variations in the exact numbers.</p>

<h1>Generate the synthetic data</h1>
<p>For the purpose of benchmarking, we’re going to create our own dataset. To ensure simplicity and uniformity, we’ll generate a dataframe containing columns like name, year of birth, and city of residence – pretty straightforward stuff. We’re aiming for a dataset of 10,000 rows. While we could certainly run this benchmark on a dataframe with more than a million rows, our intention is to provide a realistic example. The code we’ll provide allows you to effortlessly explore various scenarios according to your requirements. Feel free to use it or modify it if you want to perform your own test.</p>

<h1>Define helper class</h1>
<p>In order to streamline our code, we’ll create a convenient helper class featuring two essential methods: <code>get_time</code> and <code>get_figure</code>. The <code>get_time</code> method leverages the <code>timeit.repeat</code> function to accurately gauge the execution time of our code. In this context, we’ll set the parameters <code>number = 1</code> and <code>repeat = 100</code>. This configuration runs the operations 100 times, allowing us to derive key statistics like the mean, median, and standard deviation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <code>get_figure</code> method takes these gathered results and generates a visually appealing image using Plotly.</p>
<p>To bring it all together and keep things simple, we’ve designed the <code>run_test</code> function. This function orchestrates the entire process, seamlessly merging the steps outlined above.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="csv">CSV</h2>
<p>Reading CSV files from disk is a task that data scientists often find themselves doing. Now, let’s see how these two libraries compare for this particular job. To maximize the blazing-fast data handling capabilities of PyArrow, we’ll equip Pandas with the <code>engine="pyarrow"</code> and <code>dtype_backend="pyarrow"</code> arguments. Let’s see how these choices shape the performance!</p>

<p>As anticipated, Polars continues to showcase its swiftness. It’s worth highlighting the usage of the <code>lazy</code> and <code>collect</code> methods in Polars. These nifty tools grant us access to the library’s clever query optimization techniques, which play a pivotal role in significantly enhancing performance. OK, one step further: suppose our files are already loaded into memory. Would there still be a distinction in performance under this circumstance?</p>

<p>While Pandas showcased noteworthy speed for the simple aggregation, the more intricate task exposed significant disparities between the two libraries. Polars took a commanding lead in this scenario, presenting a considerably faster performance compared to Pandas.</p>

<h1>Whole workflow</h1>
<p>We’re going to tackle this in two versions. First, we’ll use <code>pl.read_csv</code> for Polars, assessing the time it takes to complete the entire workflow on a DataFrame already in memory. Then, for the second version, we’ll employ <code>pl.scan_csv</code> for Polars. This nifty function lets us lazily read data from a CSV file or multiple files using glob patterns.</p>
<p>The cool part? With <code>pl.scan_csv</code>, the query optimizer can push down predicates and projections to the scan level. This nifty move has the potential to cut down on memory overhead. Let’s dive into both versions and see how they stack up!</p>

<p>As evident, the utilization of <code>scan_csv</code> increased the required time by about 3-4 times. However, even with this increase, Polars still manages to maintain a substantial advantage of around 5 times faster than the entire workflow executed using Pandas.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;14: Analyzing Speed Differences Between Pandas and Polars in Common Data Science Workflow Operations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>Throughout our exploration, Polars has consistently outperformed Pandas. We intentionally focused on tasks that frequently arise in data analysis, encompassing file reading, column selection, filtering, and more. However, where Polars truly shines is in aggregation, capitalizing on its multiprocessing prowess. Take a glance at <a href="#fig-fig14">Figure&nbsp;14</a>, and you’ll notice that reading files is the most time-consuming step for Polars. To address this (and reduce memory usage at the same time), we have the nifty <code>scan_csv</code> function that enables Polars to operate in a lazy mode, optimizing the entire data pipeline. It’s clear that Polars packs a punch in the realm of data processing!</p>
<p>Should you consider using Polars? Based on the findings of this experiment, it’s evident that Polars can bring substantial benefits to every stage of your data processing. Its remarkable speed can make a significant impact. If you’re open to investing time in understanding its API (which isn’t drastically different from Pandas), I’m confident your projects will gain a significant speed boost. And don’t forget, the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/polars-seed--963c89d2">trajectory</a> of the project seems promising, implying a bright future ahead.</p>
<p>Whatever path you choose, ensure you become well-acquainted with your selected library and stay current with emerging technologies. And above all, relish the journey. Happy coding, and until next time! 🐼🐍🤓💻</p>

<span id="cb25-21"><a href="#cb25-21" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Once I shared my first article about <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">"Getting Started with Polars"</span><span class="co">](https://adamcseresznye.github.io/blog/posts/polars/Polars_revised.html)</span> I started thinking about something exciting: comparing the speed of Polars and Pandas. This curiosity was sparked by all the buzz around the brand-new <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Pandas 2.0 release</span><span class="co">](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html)</span>, promising lightning-fast performance. Pandas 2.0 was announced to come packed with cool features, including the addition of Apache Arrow (pyarrow) as its backing memory format. The big perk of Apache Arrow is that it makes operations speedier and more memory-friendly. Naturally, this got me wondering: how does Pandas 2.0 measure up against Polars? Let's dive in and find out!</span>

<span id="cb25-25"><a href="#cb25-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Keep in mind: occasionally, I refer to some performance difference figures. Even though I repeated these experiments 100 times each, because computations can have a bit of randomness, there might be slight variations in the exact numbers.</span>

<span id="cb25-602"><a href="#cb25-602" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We're going to tackle this in two versions. First, we'll use <span class="in">`pl.read_csv`</span> for Polars, assessing the time it takes to complete the entire workflow on a DataFrame already in memory. Then, for the second version, we'll employ <span class="in">`pl.scan_csv`</span> for Polars. This nifty function lets us lazily read data from a CSV file or multiple files using glob patterns.</span>

<span id="cb25-604"><a href="#cb25-604" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The cool part? With <span class="in">`pl.scan_csv`</span>, the query optimizer can push down predicates and projections to the scan level. This nifty move has the potential to cut down on memory overhead.

<span id="cb25-836"><a href="#cb25-836" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Throughout our exploration, Polars has consistently outperformed Pandas. We intentionally focused on tasks that frequently arise in data analysis, encompassing file reading, column selection, filtering, and more. However, where Polars truly shines is in aggregation, capitalizing on its multiprocessing prowess. Take a glance at @fig-fig14, and you'll notice that reading files is the most time-consuming step for Polars. To address this (and reduce memory usage at the same time), we have the nifty <span class="in">`scan_csv`</span> function that enables Polars to operate in a lazy mode, optimizing the entire data pipeline. It's clear that Polars packs a punch in the realm of data processing!</span>

<span id="cb25-838"><a href="#cb25-838" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Should you consider using Polars? Based on the findings of this experiment, it's evident that Polars can bring substantial benefits to every stage of your data processing. Its remarkable speed can make a significant impact. If you're open to investing time in understanding its API (which isn't drastically different from Pandas), I'm confident your projects will gain a significant speed boost. And don't forget, the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">trajectory</span><span class="co">](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/polars-seed--963c89d2)</span> of the project seems promising, implying a bright future ahead.</span>
