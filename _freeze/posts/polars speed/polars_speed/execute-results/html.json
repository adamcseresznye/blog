Pandas 2.0 was announced to come packed with cool features, including the addition of Apache Arrow (pyarrow) as its backing memory format. The big perk of Apache Arrow is that it makes operations speedier and more memory-friendly. Naturally, this got me wondering: how does Pandas 2.0 measure up against Polars? Let's dive in and find out!\n\n# Setup\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport polars as pl\nimport polars.selectors as cs\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport timeit\nimport random\n\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.express as px\n\npio.templates.default = \"presentation\"\n\nprint(pd.__version__)\nprint(pl.__version__)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n2.0.3\n0.18.11\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nThroughout this article, we'll be working with the latest versions of the packages: Pandas 2.0.3 and Polars 0.18.11.\n\n\n:::\n\n# Generate the synthetic data\n\nFor the purpose of benchmarking, we're going to create our own dataset. To ensure simplicity and uniformity, we'll generate a dataframe containing columns like name, year of birth, and city of residence – pretty straightforward stuff. We're aiming for a dataset of 10,000 rows. While we could certainly run this benchmark on a dataframe with more than a million rows, our intention is to provide a realistic example. The code we'll provide allows you to effortlessly explore various scenarios according to your requirements. Feel free to use it or modify it if you want to perform your own test.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef create_sample_dataframe(n_rows: int, name: str, seed: int = 42) -> pl.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a sample Polars DataFrame with the specified number of rows.\n\n    This function generates random data for several columns and creates a Polars\n    DataFrame with the specified number of rows.

The `get_time` method leverages the `timeit.repeat` function to accurately gauge the execution time of our code. In this context, we'll set the parameters `number = 1` and `repeat = 100`. This configuration runs the operations 100 times, allowing us to derive key statistics like the mean, median, and standard deviation. \n\nOn the other hand, the `get_figure` method takes these gathered results and generates a visually appealing image using Plotly. \n\nTo bring it all together and keep things simple, we've designed the `run_test` function. This function orchestrates the entire process, seamlessly merging the steps outlined above.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Timeit:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class for measuring the execution time of multiple functions.\n    This class provides methods for measuring the execution time of\n    multiple functions using the `timeit` module. The functions to be\n    tested are passed to the constructor as a dictionary, where the\n    keys are the names of the functions and the values are the functions\n    themselves. The `number` and `repeat` parameters control how many times\n    each function is executed and how many times the timing is repeated,\n    respectively.\n\n    The `get_time` method measures the execution time of each function and\n    stores the results in a dictionary, where the keys are the names of\n    the functions and the values are lists of execution times.

impressive speed for the straightforward aggregation, the more complex task revealed striking differences between the two libraries. In this case, Polars surged ahead, boasting a remarkable 80-100 times faster performance compared to Pandas.    \n:::\n\n# Whole workflow\n\nWe're going to tackle this in two versions. First, we'll use `pl.read_csv` for Polars, assessing the time it takes to complete the entire workflow on a DataFrame already in memory. Then, for the second version, we'll employ `pl.scan_csv` for Polars. This nifty function lets us lazily read data from a CSV file or multiple files using glob patterns.\n\nThe cool part? With `pl.scan_csv`, the query optimizer can push down predicates and projections to the scan level. This nifty move has the potential to cut down on memory overhead. Let's dive into both versions and see how they stack up!\n\n## Using `pl.read_csv`\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntest_dict = {\n    \"Pandas\": lambda: (\n

We intentionally focused on tasks that frequently arise in data analysis, encompassing file reading, column selection, filtering, and more. However, where Polars truly shines is in aggregation, capitalizing on its multiprocessing prowess. Take a glance at @fig-fig14, and you'll notice that reading files is the most time-consuming step for Polars. To address this (and reduce memory usage at the same time), we have the nifty `scan_csv` function that enables Polars to operate in a lazy mode, optimizing the entire data pipeline. It's clear that Polars packs a punch in the realm of data processing!\n\nShould you consider using Polars? Based on the findings of this experiment, it's evident that Polars can bring substantial benefits to every stage of your data processing. Its remarkable speed can make a significant impact. If you're open to investing time in understanding its API (which isn't drastically different from Pandas), I'm confident your projects will gain a significant speed boost. And don't forget, the [trajectory](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/polars-seed--963c89d2) of the project seems promising, implying a bright future ahead.\n\n",
